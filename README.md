# Sam-Todo-list
This project is a simple web-based To-Do List application supporting multiple unique users. Each user logs in with a username and mobile number, which acts as a password. Users can add, view, and clear tasks, with data stored in local storage. Admin functionality allows viewing all registered users. The background is set with a custom image.
